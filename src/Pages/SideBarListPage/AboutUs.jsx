      <h3 style={{marginTop:"5px"}}>What does Leanpitch mean?</h3>
      <p>
        Everything that we do in life including software development can be
        pretty much treated like a game. A player should always focus on their
        game instead of worrying about pitch. If you consider software
        development as a game, the process, tools and infrastructure are the
        pitches. We would like to curate leaner pitches for Software Development
        organizations to play their Software Development games. Hence the name
        Leanpitch.
